## 🤝 Matchmaking Flow

1. Connecting
2. Waiting for another user
3. Match Found ✅
4. Both users receive:
   - ✅ Accept Chat
   - ❌ Skip
5. If accepted ✅  → Chat starts 
6. If skipped ❌ → User re-enters queue automatically

---
## 💬 Real-Time Messaging

```text
User A → Server → User B
```

- No database storage
- Messages are ephemeral
- Low-latency relay using WebSockets

---

## 🔌 Disconnection Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|-----------|
| User leaves during chat | Partner notified + re-queued |
| User leaves during match | Match cancelled |
| WebSocket error | User marked disconnected |

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-------------|
| Frontend | React (Hooks) |
| Backend | Node.js |
| Realtime | WebSockets (`ws`) |
| Deployment | Vercel (Frontend), Railway (Backend) |

---

# 🚀 Deployment

## 🌐 Frontend (Vercel)

- Static React application
- Auto deployment via GitHub integration


---

# 🔐 Important: Secure WebSockets

Since the frontend runs on HTTPS:

```text
❌ ws://  → Blocked (Mixed Content)
✅ wss:// → Required
```


# 📡 WebSocket Event Protocol

## Client → Server

```json
{ "type": "message", "text": "Hello" }
{ "type": "accept_chat" }
{ "type": "skip_chat" }
```

# ⚠️ Known Limitations

## 🔴 Scalability

- Single-instance server
- No horizontal scaling
- Requires Redis/pub-sub for distributed scaling



## 🧠 In-Memory State

- Users stored in RAM
- Server restart = all sessions lost



## 💾 No Persistence

- No user identity
- Fully ephemeral system



## 🔄 No Reconnection Logic

- Users cannot resume sessions
- Reconnect = new anonymous identity



## 📊 Basic Matchmaking

- FIFO queue only
- No filters (interest, location, etc.)

---

# 📈 Future Improvements

- 🔁 Redis for distributed matchmaking
- 👤 User sessions & reconnection
- 🎯 Interest-based matching
- 🟡 Typing indicators & read receipts
- ⚖️ Load balancing with sticky sessions
